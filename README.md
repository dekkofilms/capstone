# Capstone Project

# Concept: 
I want to create a way for passive giving. When the user signs up, they can also link a card that they use often, as well as, choosing a few of there favorite charities. The app will keep track of their purchases and round up every purchase to the nearest dollar. When a certain threshold is hit (i.e. $5) I will then deposit the money to the charity of their choice.

# Stack:
Swift
Firebase or Node Server w/ PSQL
Plaid API (hopefully)
...these are the main three components to get up and running

# Basic Wireframe Concept: (NOT final)
